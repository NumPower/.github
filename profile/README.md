## Hi dev ðŸ‘‹

Inspired by NumPy, the NumPower extension was created to provide the foundation for efficient scientific computing in PHP, as well as leverage the machine learning tools and libraries that already exist and can benefit from it.

This C extension developed for PHP can be used to considerably speed up mathematical operations on large datasets and facilitate the manipulation, creation and operation of N-dimensional tensors.
